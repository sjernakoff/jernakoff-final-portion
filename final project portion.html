	<h1>Introduction/Overview</h1>
	<p>The National Gallery of Art Library, founded in 1941, accompanied the public opening of the National Gallery of Art with the mission of supporting the institution’s staff members and visiting researchers in their curatorial and research needs. The NGA Library’s collection contains 500,000+ books and periodicals on art, history, theory, architecture, and art criticism, particularly (though not exclusively) focusing on Europe and the United States. The library is located within the East Building of the National Gallery and includes a study center, rare book room, and library and image collections. The NGA Library also hosts an online catalog which can be searched on site or remotely and allows users to search not only the library’s owned content but also its digital serial subscriptions, its extensive image collection, its auction catalogs, and more.</p><br>
	<h1>Background: Behind the Scenes Tech</h1>
	<p>We reached out to the NGA Library staff via email and requested some technical information about their systems for this project. Head of Technical Services at the National Gallery Library, Sarah Osborne Bender, volunteered to help answer our questions and provide a behind-the-scenes look at their website.</p>
	<p>The library’s main web pages, like the broader NGA.gov site, are managed at the institutional level. This includes the <a href="https://www.nga.gov/research/library.html">home landing page</a> along with the links to make appointments, contact librarians, and view collection highlights. The <a href="https://library.nga.gov/discovery/search?vid=01NGA_INST:NGA">library search website</a> is managed by NGA Libraries specifically. Their search system is powered by Ex Libris Primo VE discovery layer, which has been in use since November 2018. This UI will be familiar to CUA students as it is the same system behind the CUA Libraries search site. Two additional services are used to help present locally digitized collection content: “an embedded <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/iiif-viewers/">IIIF viewer</a> [International Image Interoperability Framework] delivers image content into the bib record view. And the image files and image metadata is pulled from the institution's digital asset management system, <a href="https://www.netx.net/">NetX</a>.”</p>
	<p>The public facing library and catalog search website does not interface with any collections or catalogs inside or outside of NGA as an institution; it is a self-contained search system. The majority of the NGA Library collection is at least partially described and fully discoverable in the library catalog, but NOT through the NGA.gov website search. It is important to note that within the Vertical File collection, however, records are described at the folder level rather than the item level. Some items, especially within the expansive Image Collection, are described only at the “‘summary’ level to at least indicate that image holdings exist for a particular artist or grouping.”</p>
	<p>Osborne Bender added that “Though there is not linkage or other exchange…our permanent collection is managed using <a href="https://www.gallerysystems.com/tms-collections/tms-suite/tms/tms/">TMS collection management system</a> and our institutional archives uses <a href="https://archivesspace.org/">ArchiveSpace</a>. Our conservation department uses <a href="https://museumspace.com/conservationspace/">Conservation Space</a> for management of their data and images. None of these have public-facing search layers, though our archives is moving in that direction.” She also let us know that a new version of the main NGA website will be launched soon.</p>
	<p>One challenge experienced by the NGA Library staff with the library website is that, as part of a large institution with very controlled branding, any edits made to the main library webpage are carried out by a separate technical department and cannot be controlled or carried out by library staff outside of simply submitting change requests. However, the library search website in particular is under much more direct control of the library staff: “We can change content and design on these pages, though we want seamless visual continuity with the rest of nga.gov. We can also make changes to the configuration that impacts searching (what and how MARC fields are indexed, for example), change the bib record display to include local fields or local field labels, add and remove functions (such as citation tools, etc).” Another challenge Osborne Bender described is the question of what search scope to use as a default, with possibilities including just the “library” (print collection, subscribed online serials, purchased/licensed ebooks); the auction catalog collection; the image collection; only items owned by the library (the current default); electronic and digital content only; and “everything.” Each scope has its benefits and drawbacks for both the user and the librarians who are trying to ensure that the fullest extent of their collections are discoverable and usable by their patrons.</p>
	<p>Some strengths of the system, in Osborne Bender’s opinion, are the high quality of their cataloging, the embedded viewer for digitized content, and the power of their Primo VE search tool, all of which streamlines the process of connecting users to the content they are looking for. In the future, NGA Library is hoping to connect the NGA Library resources with the broader resources of the National Gallery in one search interface. This “would strengthen the meaning and relationships between original artworks, archival resources, scholarly publications, auction catalogs, conservation notes, and images,” in keeping with a current trend among other libraries, museums, and cultural heritage institutions.</p>
